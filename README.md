This was built with the T3 Stack project bootstrapped with create-t3-app with:

- React (Next.js)
- Built with Bun
- MUI Component Library
- Drizzle ORM
- Vercel hosting
- Postgres Database(via Vercel)
- Clerk Authentication
- Sentry Error Detection
- PostHog Analytics

The main purpose of this project is to get my head around Nextjs as well as the Vercel ecosystem, and to explore a tech stack to get projects up and running

### NOTES:

- Based off this T3 Stack tutorial from TheoT3 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5x0JCZbAJs
- Vercel/Postgres was real easy to use
- Drizzle was a nice experience.
- Clerk was a simple set up, no problems
- For some reason, this project doesn't like it when i use yarn to add packages so i had to use npm.
- Readme checkbox system was a good simple way to keep track of features.
- Ran into a lot of difficulties getting used to NextJS (lack of state in server app made modals difficult)
- Use tailwind for on the fly changes, just makes things way easier.
- Sentry is probably overkill for this kind of app
- Will be better to implement Debugging earlier, for whatever reason it didn't work the first time.
- I felt there was a little bit of lag, but idk if it was just in development environment.
